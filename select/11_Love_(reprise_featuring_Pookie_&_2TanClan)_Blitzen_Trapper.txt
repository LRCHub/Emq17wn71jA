Love! I exclaim
L-L-Love! I exclaim
It brings the body down
Now, drips drippin' tame
Yeah, I've been sailin' under
Aren't you afraid?
We'll roll that water under
Love! I exclaim
L-L-L-Love! I exclaim
It brings the body down
Now drips drippin' tame
Love! I exclaim

To split the heart asunder
Blowin' 'way

Love! I exclaim
It brings the body down
Now don't shake the blame
Split the heart asunder
Love! I exclaim
Roll that water under
We roll that water under
Love! I exclaim
It brings the body down
Now don't take the blame
Your love's been sailin' under
Aren't you afraid?
To split the heart asunder
Love! I exclaim
We roll that water under
We roll that water under
